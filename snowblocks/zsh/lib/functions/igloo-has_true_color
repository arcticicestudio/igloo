# Checks if the terminal has 24-bit color ("true color") support and if it has not been disabled via the custom
# `IGLOO_ZSH_NO_TRUE_COLOR` environment variable.
# Note that support for 24-bit ("true color") terminals is only available for ZSH versions >=5.7 that allows
# to use HEX triplets when specifying colors for prompts and line editor highlighting.
# See:
#   1. http://zsh.sourceforge.net/releases.html ("Changes between 5.6.2 and 5.7")
