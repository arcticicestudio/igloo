# JetBrains IDEs

This snowblock provides all important configurations for all used [JetBrains][] IDEs and products, currently [IntelliJ][] (Ultimate Edition), [PyCharm][] (Community Edition), [Webstorm][] and [GoLand][]. For details about the paths for user configurations see the documentation about [directories used by the IDE to store settings, caches, plugins and logs][intellij-doc-settings-paths].

## Configurations

### Typeface

Due to licensing and the availability of specific font families on different operating systems the preferences for the sans-serif UI typefaces must be configured manually using the IntelliJ UI (_Preferences_ → _Appearance & Behavior_ → _Appearance_ → _UI Options_) or by adding the following `<option>` entries with the desired font family names:

```xml
<!-- Linux -->
<option name="FONT_FACE" value="Noto Sans" />

<!-- macOS (default font families) -->
<option name="FONT_FACE" value=".SF NS Text" />
```

The default and secondary monospace fonts for the editor typeface are system independent and have already been set in the [`editor.xml`][gh-igloo-sb-jb-editor.xml] file to [Source Code Pro][google-font-source-code-pro] and [Hack][font-hack]:

```xml
<option name="FONT_FAMILY" value="Source Code Pro" />
<option name="SECONDARY_FONT_FAMILY" value="Hack" />
```

### snowsaw core plugins

JetBrains uses a [naming scheme for the folder all user configurations][intellij-doc-settings-paths] are stored in based on the product major/minor version! This requires this snowblock to be updated as soon as the product gets updated to adapt to the new version string based on the pattern `<PRODUCT><VERSION>`.

The base target folder name for the `clean` and `link` plugins must be updated after updating to a new product version. Next to this, the `clean` plugin should also keep the previous target paths to ensure they are cleaned up after updating.
